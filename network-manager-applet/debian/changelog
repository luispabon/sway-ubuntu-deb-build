  [ Josselin Mouette ]
  * debian/patches/05-8021x-passwords-user.patch: patch from upstream git.
    Correctly set 802.1x passwords as agent-owned, so that they are stored
    in the user’s keyring.
  * debian/patches/11-user-connections.patch: new patch. Set passwords as
    agent-owned when they need to, to allow users without root permissions
    to easily configure their connections. (Closes: #696256)
    The logic is:
    - Bluetooth, CDMA and GSM connections: always user-owned
    - WEP/WPA connections: system-owned if user has the permissions
      (with NM’s config, that is netdev or sudo membership), user-owned
      otherwise. The password is stored in the keyring for WPA, not for
      WEP.
    - WiMax / Wired connections: always system-owned (with 802.1x
      passwords in the keyring).
